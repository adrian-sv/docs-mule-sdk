The module *must* follow all standard security best practices.

In particular, the following *should* be given special consideration:

* Protect against XXE attacks
* Always sanitize information from untrusted sources
* When reading files from the local file system, make sure not to access secrets of the host environment nor enable path traversal
* When possible, use CSRF tokens
* When executing queries to a database, make correct use of PreparedStatement class to avoid SQL injection attacks.
