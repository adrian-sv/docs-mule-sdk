== Ignore Operations or Endpoints

If you don’t want to generate an operation in the connector for a
resource that is present in the API spec, you must use the `ignored`
property. You can define the ignored property at endpoint or operation
level.

If you ignore an endpoint, none of the operations defined under the
endpoint are generated.

If you ignore an operation, only that operation is not generated; the
rest of the operations for that endpoint are generated.

== Ignore an Operation

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      operations:
         delete:
            ignored: true
----

In this case, only the DELETE verb is ignored. Operations are still
generated for the other verbs in the resource.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /flights/{ID}:
      ignored: true
----

In this case, all of the endpoint verbs will be ignored. No operations
will be generated for this resource.

== Set a Display Name for an Operation Name

You can define the display name of an operation by using the `name`
property in the operation node.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            name: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     friendlyName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

By setting this property, the operation is available to the final user
with the display name in the UI:

== Set a Description for an Operation

You can define the description of an operation by using the
`description` property in the operation node.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            name: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     friendlyName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

The `description` property can be used to give the final user of the
connector some context or explanation of what the operation does. It
appears in Anypoint Studio as a tooltip.

[[select-default-media-type-for-an-operation]]
== Select a Default Media Type for an Operation

Both RAML and OAS API specs allow you to define multiple media types for
the operations.

REST SDK uses only one media type to generate the operation.

If it is not defined using a custom property, the default one is
selected following this priority:

* _application/json_ if it is defined
* _application/xml_ if it is defined
* The first media type defined in the API spec for that body

If you want to select the operation media type manually, you can use the
`inputMediaType` and `outputMediaType` properties. These properties
allow you to define the request body media type and the response media
type respectively.

[source,yaml]
----
endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            name: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            inputMediaType: application/json
            outputMediaType: application/json
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     friendlyName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

== Select a Default Media Type for All Operations

If you want to select a default media type for your operations like
defined in xref:rest-sdk/configure-operations.adoc#select-default-media-type-for-an-operation[Select a Default Media Type for an Operation] but you want
to do it globally, you can use the `defaultInputMediaType` and
`defaultOutputMediaType` properties at the root level of the Connector
Descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
defaultInputMediaType: application/json
defaultOutputMediaType: application/json

endpoints:
   /content_search:
      operations:
         get:
            pagination: content-search-pagination
            name: Get Content Search
            description: Provides keyword and refinement search functionality for content assets.
            expects:
               queryParameter:
                  count:
                     friendlyName: count
                     description: The maximum number of instances per request.
----

== Redefine an Operation Input/Output Type

The API spec may not define an input/output type; if you need one, you
can use the `inputType` and `outputType` properties in the Connector
Descriptor. You can set these properties at the operation level in the
connector descriptor. +
 +
For example, let’s say we have the following OAS spec.

[source,json5]
----
{
"paths": {
 "/payment_instrument/{payment_instrument_id}": {
   "post": {
     "responses": {
       "default": {
         "description": ""
       }
     }
   }
//[..]
}
----

In this case, the operation does not define input or output metadata. +
You can add it using the following descriptor:

[source,yaml]
----
defaultInputMediaType: application/json
defaultOutputMediaType: application/json

endpoints:
 /payment_instrument/{payment_instrument_id}:
   operations:
     post:
       inputType: './payment-instrument.json'
       outputType: './payment-instrument.json'
----

The operation uses the type definition from that schema as input and
output metadata. +
The value of this property must be the path to a JSON schema relative to
the location of the connector descriptor file. +
 +
In this case, the JSON schema appears as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
 "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
 "$ref": "#/definitions/PaymentInstrument",
 "definitions": {
   "PaymentInstrument": {
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "name": {"type": "string"}
   },
   "required": [
     "name"
   ]
 }}
}
----

== Override an Operation Input/Output Type

You can also use the inputType and outputType properties to override the
type that is defined in the API spec. If a type is defined in the
connector descriptor, the one in the API spec is ignored.


== Skip Output Type Validations

`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS` operations defined in the API spec must declare a response body and a type for that body. If they do not, the connector descriptor must skip this check, define a response body for the operation, or declare it as void. +
+
Though is not the recommended approach, you can skip the this check using the `skipOutputTypeValidation` property in the connector descriptor.

It can be used at the operation level or globally.

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
apiSpec:
  url: './api.raml'
connectorName: Version Manager
skipOutputTypeValidation: true           #<-- Global
endpoints:
  /endpoints/users:
    operations:
      get:
        skipOutputTypeValidation: true   #<-- Operation Level
----

If the validation is skipped, the generated connector still generates an `InputStream` output for the operation, and it contains the actual server response, but without informing the user that this operation has an output. This is not recommended and should be avoided as much as possible.

If the operation does not have an output, the `voidOperation` property should be used instead of this.

== Void Operations

`GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS` operations defined in the API spec must declare a response body and a type for that body. If they don't, the connector descriptor must skip this check, define a response body for the operation, or declare it as void.

You can declare the operation as void using the `voidOperation` property of the operation node in the connector descriptor:

[source,yaml]
----
#% Rest Connector Descriptor 1.0
apiSpec:
 url: './api.raml'
connectorName: Version Manager
endpoints:
 /endpoints/void:
   operations:
     get:
       voidOperation: true   #<-- Operation Level
----

Using this property causes the operation to not have an `InputStream` as output. Instead, it always returns an empty string output. Using this property also causes the actual server response to be discarded. The HTTP response properties are still returned as attributes.
