== Add a Custom Icon to Your Module

Module icons are files in the SVG format.

To customize the icon of a connector, add an icon.svg file that contains the custom icon under the icon folder in the root of the connector tree.

The following image shows an example of the folder structure for the icon:

Once you add the icon to your custom connector, it will appear in Exchange and Anypoint Studio.
