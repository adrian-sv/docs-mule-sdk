Java SDK includes several features that support field-level capabilities
for value providers and sample data. Using these features enables you to define
value providers for parameter fields, or to use parameter fields as acting
parameters for either a value provider or sample data.

These features are available for Mule 4.4.0, however, connectors can use
the features without upgrading their minimum Mule version.

== Defining a Value Provider for a Part of a Parameter

You can declare a value provider for a parameter field by using the
annotation *@FieldValues*.

The *@FieldValues* annotation requires:

* *value*
+
Provides values for a field.
* *targetSelectors*
+
Describes which part of a parameter contains the values that are given by the value provider.
It is defined through the DataWeave syntax to describe the selector through
nested fields, XML attributes, or fields that contain spaces in their names.

The following is an example of an operation that includes values provided for
a parameter named `body`, which is a JSON input stream:

----
public class ChatOperations {
 public void sendChatMessage(@Connection ChatConnection chatConnection,
       @FieldValues(value = WorkspacesValueProvider.class, targetSelectors = "routingInfo.workspace")
       @TypeResolver(ChatMessageResolver.class) @Content InputStream body) {
    // Do message sending
  }
}
----

The `body` parameter has a field named *routingInfo*, which has a field named
`workspace`. *WorkspacesValueProvider* is a value provider that uses the
connection and retrieves possible workspaces.

== Defining a Value Provider for Several Parts of a Parameter

Parameters can have more than one part where values are provided.
The *@FieldValues* annotation is a repeatable annotation, so parameters can be
annotated multiple times.

The following is an example of an operation with a parameter named
`body`, which is a JSON input stream that has two parts with values that
can be provided:

----
public class ChatOperations {
 public void sendChatMessage(@Connection ChatConnection chatConnection,
       @FieldValues(value = WorkspacesValueProvider.class, targetSelectors = "routingInfo.workspace")
       @FieldValues(value = ChannelIdValueProvider.class, targetSelectors = "channelId")
       @TypeResolver(ChatMessageResolver.class) @Content InputStream body) {
    // Do message sending
  }
}
----

The parameter `body` defines values for two fields (*routingInfo.workspace* and
*channelId*) that have values that are independent of each other.

== Defining a Multilevel Value Provider for Several Parts of a Parameter

You can use multilevel value providers for several parts of a parameter.

Suppose in the previous example you want the values for the *channelId* field
to depend on the values for the *routingInfo.workspace* field.

To define this, the *targetSelectors* attribute from the *@FieldValues* annotation
must receive an array of strings. If more than one string is given, a multilevel
value provider is defined. Each given field defines the value parts of the
value provider, the order in the array, and the order of the value part.

The following example shows how to define multilevel value providers
for parameter parts:

----
public class ChatOperations {
 public void sendChatMessage(@Connection ChatConnection chatConnection,
      @FieldValues(value = ChatMultiLevelValueProvider.class,  targetSelectors = {"workspace", "channelId"})
      @TypeResolver(ChatMessageResolver.class) @Content InputStream body) {}
}
----

The multilevel value provider is included like any other value provider.

The following is an example of what a multilevel value provider looks like:

----
public class ChatMultiLevelValueProvider implements ValueProvider {

 @Connection
 private ChatConnection chatConnection;

 @Override
 public Set<Value> resolve() {
   Set<Value> values = new HashSet<>();
   List<String> workspaces = chatConnection.getWorkspaces();
   workspaces.stream().forEach(workspace -> {
     ValueBuilder valueBuilder = newValue(workspace);
     chatConnection.getChannels(workspace).stream().forEach(channel -> valueBuilder.withChild(newValue(channel)));
     values.add(valueBuilder.build());
   });
   return values;
 }

 @Override
 public String getId() {
   return "Chat multilevel value provider";
 }
}
----

== Defining a Value Provider for XML Attributes

Target selectors use the DataWeave syntax. If a parameter of an operation is an
XML element, you can use this syntax to define a value provider for an attribute that
is a part of that parameter.

The following example shows how the DataWeave syntax defines a value provider
for an attribute:

----
public class ChatOperations {
 public void sendChatMessage(@Connection ChatConnection chatConnection,
      @FieldValues(value = ChannelIdValueProvider.class,  targetSelectors = "message.target.@channelId")
      @TypeResolver(XmlChatMessageResolver.class) @Content InputStream body) {}
}
----

In this example, the `body` parameter is an XML element that has a root tag named
*message*, which has a *target* that has the *channelId* attribute and an
associated value provider.

== Define Acting Parameters as Parts of Parameters

To define acting parameters as parts of parameters, components must define
bindings for their references for value providers and sample data providers.
These bindings enable an acting parameter of the provider to take the value of
the evaluated DataWeave expression.

When no binding is defined for an acting parameter, the same implicit binding
will be applied. The name of the acting parameter must be the same as the name
of the parameter in the component to take that parameterâ€™s value.

Use the *@Binding* annotation to define an acting parameter. The *@FieldValues*
annotation and the `@SampleData` annotation can be given an array of bindings
to define the values the acting parameter must take.

When a binding is defined, it declares the value an acting parameter will
take by giving an extraction expression. This extraction expression is a
DataWeave expression that uses only selectors to retrieve the value for the
acting parameter.

The available context for the expression has the value of all the component's
parameters. The expression must start with the name of the parameter of the
component. If the value comes from a part of the parameter, the expression
follows the selector to the desired field.

The following is an example where a parameter named `body` has a field with
values that depend on the acting parameter `workspace`:

----
public class ChatOperations {
 public void sendChatMessage(@Connection ChatConnection chatConnection,
       @FieldValues(value = ChannelsValueProvider.class, targetSelectors = "channelId",
     bindings = {@Binding(actingParameter = "workspace",  extractionExpression = "body.routingInfo.workspace")}))
       @TypeResolver(ChatMessageResolver.class) @Content InputStream body) {
    // Do message sending
  }
}
----

This acting parameter is taken from the same `body` parameter.

The following shows the value provider used in this example:

----
public class ChannelsValueProvider implements ValueProvider {

 @Connection
 private ChatConnection chatConnection;

 @Parameter
 private String workspace;

 @Override
 public Set<Value> resolve() {
   return ValueBuilder.getValuesFor(chatConnection.getChannels(workspace));
 }

 @Override
 public String getId() {
   return "Channels value provider";
 }
}
----

The `workspace` acting parameter defined in the value provider is bound to the
extraction expression that takes the value of the field from the context
of the component.

== Sample Data Example

The following is an example of a `@SampleData` annotation that binds an acting
parameter to the value of a field of a parameter in the component:

----
public class ChatOperations {
@SampleData(value = ChatMessageSampleDatatProvider.class, bindings = {@Binding(actingParameter = "workspace",  extractionExpression = "body.routingInfo.workspace")}))
 public Result<InputStream, ChatAttributes> retrieveChatMessage(@Connection ChatConnection chatConnection,
         @TypeResolver(ChatMessageResolver.class) @Content InputStream body) {
    // Do chat message retrieval
  }
}
----

In the *ChatMessageSampleDatatProvider*, there is a parameter named `workspace`
that provides the sample data. The value of this acting parameter
is taken from the extraction expression defined in the binding.

== Extraction Expression Restrictions

The extraction expression used for the extraction of the value of the acting
parameter does not aggregate any data from the context. It must be limited to
access only the value of a field in the parameter.

The first part of this extraction expression must also correspond to the
name of a parameter from the component.

== Java Type Limitation

When executing the extraction expression to give values to the acting
parameters of a value provider or sample data provider, the output media type
is always `application/java`. This means that the provider must not expect
other media types, such as `application/json` or `application/xml`.

== Parameters Static Metadata

When resolving acting parameter values, you must know the media types of the
parameters from the component to execute the extraction expression and give
the acting parameter its value.

To retrieve the media type of the parameter, use the static metadata of the
parameter. For example, if the parameter is a JSON input stream but the static
metadata does not reflect this, the parts of the parameter cannot be used as
acting parameters.
